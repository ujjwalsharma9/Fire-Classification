# Fire - Classification

Fire Classification has been done by creating Flame and Smoke classifying models using TensorFlow Image Hub Retraining API ( https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/image_retraining ).

Model: MobileNet V2

Datasets used:

[1] FireSense (https://zenodo.org/record/836749#.XFkUHlwzbIU)

[2] http://smoke.ustc.edu.cn/datasets.htm


Classifying apps were created by converting to mobilenet(.pb) models to TFlite(.lite) models and following sets given in TensorFlowForPoets(https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2-tflite/#1)
